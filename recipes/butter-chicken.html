	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p class="desc">This is a simple home version of butter chicken, also known as 'murgh' or 'chicken makhani', a popular dish in Indian restaurants. This is best served with naan, an Indian bread, or you can also serve this with basmati rice. </p>

	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>⅓ cup plain nonfat yogurt</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon tandoori masala powder</li>
		<li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
		<li>½ onion, chopped</li>
		<li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger</li>
		<li>1 clove garlic</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons water</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons cooking oil, divided</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
		<li>¼ teaspoon Indian chili powder</li>
		<li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
		<li>1 cup half and half</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Steps</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Stir the yogurt and tandoori masala powder together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; add the chicken and toss to coat evenly. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
		<li>Puree the onion, ginger, and garlic with the water in a blender until it forms a smooth paste; set aside.</li>
		<li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken in the hot oil until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
		<li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons in the skillet. Fry the onion paste in the hot oil until the moisture is mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
		<li>Sprinkle the garam masala and chili powder over the mixture; cook 1 minute more.</li>
		<li>Pour the tomato sauce into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook another 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Return the chicken to the pan along with the half and half; bring to a boil.</li>
		<li>Add the butter, fenugreek leaves, and salt; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>Serve with naan or white rice.</li>
